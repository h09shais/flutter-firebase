# Flutter Firebase Codelab

## Overview

In this workshop I wan't to show how to implement Firebase into a Flutter app.

We will build on top of an existing todo app and implement simple interacting between the database and the app. Such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting a task.

I will show how to setup up the app with Firebase and how to create a Firebase project.

I will not show anything more than Firebase's Firestore which is the database we will use in this codelab.

## About Firebase

TODO: write about Firebase

## Prerequisite

Have a Google account that you will use for login to Firebase.

Have the project downloaded from GitHub.

Be able to run Flutter on either a simulator or physical device.
